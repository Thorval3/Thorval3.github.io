                <p>Swifty cones were created by Bill, Ted, And Joe Anderson. These three men came to america back in 1955 as italian immigrants with lots of creative and fantastical flavors in mind for delicious ice cream. Starting out they only had 6 flavors and today with there descendants at the head they are at 20 unique flavors  with some flavors being special limited time offerings throughout the year.
